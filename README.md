# TIDYTUBES

This repository holds the web application for our group project for the subject DBW at UPF, academic year 2020/2021.

The goal is, to code a web application that uses a databank management using mySQL embeded in php code to be included in a web page written in html.
For the style we use simple CSS and javascript as well as bootstrap.

The web applicaltion is directed towards laboratory groups to get an easy to use organizational tool for their freezing system.
We aim to simplify the logistical processes behind several researchers and (bio)medical staff accessing the same storage system for objects like tubes, plasmides, cells, antibodies, etc.

Users can sign up in only a few clicks. Each lab group has an admin that is permitted to enter and change the freezing storage containers in the system.
Using the iD of the freezing storage, users can gain access to make entries within the database of this storage.

By entering information on your samples that you want to freeze in, the user can easily get an overview on his frozen goods or use the search function to find a specific entry.
